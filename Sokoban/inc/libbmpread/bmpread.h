/* Loads the specified bitmap file from disk and fills out a bmpread_t struct
 * with data about it.
 *
 * Inputs:
 * bmp_file - The filename of the bitmap file to load.
 * flags - One or more BMPREAD_* flags (defined above), combined with bitwise
 *         or.  Specify 0 for standard, OpenGL compliant behavior.
 * p_bmp_out - Pointer to a bmpread_t struct to fill with information.
 *
 * Returns:
 * 0 if there's an error (file doesn't exist or is invalid, i/o error, etc.),
 * or nonzero if the file loaded ok.
 *
 * Notes:
 * The file must be a Windows format bitmap file, 1, 4, 8, or 24 bits, and not
 * compressed (no RLE).
 *
 * Default behavior is for bmpread to return rgb_data in a format directly
 * usable by OpenGL texture functions (e.g. glTexImage2D, format GL_RGB, type
 * GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE).  This implies a few oddities:
 *  * Lines are ordered bottom-first.  To return data starting with the top
 *    line like you might otherwise expect, pass BMPREAD_TOP_DOWN in flags.
 *  * Lines are padded to be divisible by 4.  To return data with no padding,
 *    pass BMPREAD_BYTE_ALIGN in flags.
 *  * Images with width or height that aren't an integer power of 2 will fail
 *    to load.  To allow loading images of arbitrary size, pass
 *    BMPREAD_ANY_SIZE in flags.
 * Note that passing any flags may cause the image to be unusable as an OpenGL
 * texture, which may or may not matter to you.
